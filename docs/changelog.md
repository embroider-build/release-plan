# Changelog

Release Plan will generate a Changelog from your pull requests title. It is
using the [`github-changelog`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-changelog)
package to gather all changes for the next release.

By default `github-changelog` will show all pull requests that have been merged
since the latest tagged commit in the repository. That is however only true for
pull requests with certain labels applied. The labels that are supported by
default are:

- `breaking` (:boom: Breaking Change)
- `enhancement` (:rocket: Enhancement)
- `bug` (:bug: Bug Fix)
- `documentation` (:memo: Documentation)
- `internal` (:house: Internal)

## Configuration

You can configure `github-changelog` in various ways. The easiest way is by
adding a `changelog` key to the `package.json` file of your project:

```json5
{
  // ...
  "changelog": {
    "labels": {
      "feature": "New Feature",
      "bug": "Bug Fix"
    }
  }
}
```

The supported options are:

- `repo`: Your "org/repo" on GitHub
  (automatically inferred from the `package.json` file)

- `github`: the github domain, default: github.com

- `nextVersion`: Title for unreleased commits
  (e.g. `Unreleased`)

- `labels`: GitHub PR labels mapped to changelog section headers

- `wildcardLabel`: A label to identify commits that don't have a GitHub PR label
  which matches a value in `labels`. (e.g. `unlabeled`) By default, this has no
  value. [Read more about this option](#wildcardlabel).

- `ignoreCommitters`: List of committers to ignore (exact or partial match).
  Useful for example to ignore commits from bots.

- `cacheDir`: Path to a GitHub API response cache to avoid throttling
  (e.g. `.changelog`)

### `wildcardLabel`

For some projects, it may be beneficial to list PRs in the changelog that don't
have a matching label defined in the configuration `labels`. Listing these PRs also allows you to review the changelog and identify any PRs that should be re-labeled on GitHub. For example, forgetting to label a breaking change.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "changelog": {
    "wildcardLabel": "unlabeled"
  }
}
```

A default changlog heading of `:present: Additional updates` is set when a value for `wildcardLabel` is in the configuration.

```md
## Unreleased (2018-05-24)

#### üéÅ Additional updates
* [#514](https://github.com/my-org/my-repo/pull/514) Setting to mute video ([@diligent-developer](https://github.com/diligent-developer))
```

You can overwrite the default heading by including the `wildcardLabel` value in the configuration's `labels` object. For example:

```json5
{
  // ...
  "changelog": {
    "labels": {
      "feature": "New Feature",
      "bug": "Bug Fix",
      "unlabeled": "Unlabeled PRs"
    },
    "wildcardLabel": "unlabeled"
  }
}
```
